# Instructions For the Demos

Might as well put these here.

## Mandelbrot

You can zoom in on a region in the Mandelbrot viewer demo by clicking and dragging.
Zoom back out again by right clicking (or ctrl+click).

## Conway's Game of Life

Click and drag to paint randomness onto the game canvas.

## Boids

The boids will follow the mouse, that's about it.

## Matrix

This one isn't interactive. Just watch and wonder!
